How to install Samba and set up the router to fetch web content remotely:

Install & Setup Samba (run all these steps on the linux host):
	1) Install Samba
		sudo apt-get install samba
	2) Create a samba user (this is seperate from linux username/password)
		sudo smbpasswd -a $USER
	3) Create a folder that will hold the webpages in your user directory and make it writable by all
		mkdir /home/$USER/remote_www
		chmod a+w /home/$USER/remote_www
	4) Make a backup of the default Samba configuration file
		sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.default
	5) Append to the Samba config file to add the directory to share (this is all a single command):
		cat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/samba/smb.conf
		[remote_www]
		path = /home/$USER/remote_www
		available = yes
		read only = no
		browsable = yes
		public = yes
		writable = yes
		follow symlinks = yes
		wide links = yes
		EOF
	6) Restart Samba Server
		sudo restart smbd

Connect to share from the router:
	7) Under Administration | CIFS Client, set the following settings:
		Enable: <check>
		UNC: \\192.168.1.2\remote_www  (or whatever the IP of the linux machine is)
		Username: easydev (whatever your linux username is)
	   	Password: easydev (whatever the samba password you made is)
	   	Security: None
	8) Save the settings

Log in to the router and change httpd to fetch files from share:
	9) Log in to the router using SSH (this may have to be enabled through the GUI, I would also suggest adding your an ssh key for passwordless login)
	       ssh root@192.168.1.1 (or whatever your router's ip address is) 
               (password is your router's admin password)
	10) Copy all the existing files to the share
	    	 cp -r /www/* /cifs1/.
	11) Kill the existing webserver
	    	 killall httpd
	12) Restart the webserver from the cifs1 directory
	    	 cd /cifs1
		 httpd
	13) Exit the router using the exit command
	    	 exit
	14) Change the permissions on the newly copied files so you can edit them
	    	 cd /home/$USER/remote_www
		 sudo chown -R $USER *

Everything should now be served up from your linux machine and you are free to edit things!
