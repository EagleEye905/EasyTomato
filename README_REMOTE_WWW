How to install Samba and set up the router to fetch web content remotely:

Install & Setup Samba (run all these steps on the linux host):
	1) Install Samba
		sudo apt-get install samba
	2) Create a samba user (this is seperate from linux username/password)
		sudo smbpasswd -a easydev
	3) Create a folder that will hold the webpages in your user directory
		mkdir /home/<username>/remote_www
	4) Make a backup of the default Samba configuration file
		sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.default
	5) Append to the Samba config file to add the directory to share (this is all a single command):
		sudo cat << EOF >> /etc/samba/smb.conf
		[remote_www]
		path = /home/<username>/remote_www
		available = yes
		read only = no
		browsable = yes
		public = yes
		writable = yes
		follow symlinks = yes
		wide links = yes
	6) Restart Samba Server
		sudo restart smbd
